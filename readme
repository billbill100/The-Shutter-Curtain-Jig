The Shutter Curtain Jig

This is for Zenit cameras.

The jig allows correct placement of the first curtain ribbons
and second curtain onto the drum.

They can then be glued to the drum.

This is an ongoing project in early alpha stage, so please give feedback and comments.

THe jig will be updated and modified based on trials and user feedback.


Next folder is the Shutter Keep

A disc fits into the top of the drum to engage the second curtain.
The flat plate then sits on top of the shutter crate holding the three axles.

This makes it much easierto align the drum and blinds.
