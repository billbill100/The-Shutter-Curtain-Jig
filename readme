Hi, here is a list of the folders and what can be found in them

Please be aware that these parts are still in development so please give feedback via Thew Zenit Camera Club Facebook group, or post comments here.
Improvements/modifications will be made upon the feedback to improve upon them.
Also any suggestions and ideas for new tools or accerssories are always welcome.


The Shutter Curtain Jig
The jig allows the shutter cuertains (blinds) to be re-glued onto the drum and rollers
ensuring they are correctly located on the drum, which is mm critical for correct operation
and keeps them all sqaure.

THe jig will be updated and modified based on trials and user feedback.


The Shutter Keep.
This allows the drumm and rollers to be assembled onto the lower bearing plate, making alignment and testing easier.

There are three parts to The Shutter Keep,

The hub sits in the top of the drum, with the dog facing down to engage the second curtain and lock it's rotation against the brass upper part of the drum, as it would when mounted in the camera.

The top plate holds the top of the drum and rollers in position

and the strap can be used to hold the top plate in position. 

Ensure the exposed gear at the base of the drum is rotated fully anti-clockwise when the drum & curtains are in the correct 'fired' position.
This gear stops the drum rotating further, which would otherwise rip the ribbons & blind off th drum.

Tension can now be added to the rollers and operation ofthe shutter checked for operation & correct alignment.

Before removing The Shutter Keep, tension must be removed from the rollers.


The Tension Adjusting Tool.
This works as a socket and fits onto the star lock-nuts that hold the two rollers.
It allows the existing tension of the roller spring to be kept whilst loosening the locknut. Thus a small amout of additional tension can be added or released.

The central hole allows a screwdriver to slide into, engaging with the slot on the end of the roller spindle.
This may need drilling out to fit the shaft diameter of your screwdriver.

On first use, the star nut has to be removed from the camera and heated to no more than 200 degrees. A soldering iron is good for this.
Then place on a non-meltable surface and push the end of the tool onto the nut, so the shape is formed into the plastic.

When cool the nut is removed, leaving the impression.
Note it will be a tigh fit, so may be difficult to remove the nut.
