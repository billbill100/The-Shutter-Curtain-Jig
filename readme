The Shutter Curtain Jig

This is for Zenit cameras.

The jig allows correct placement of the first curtain ribbons
and second curtain onto the drum.

They can then be glued to the drum.

This is an ongoing project in early alpha stage, so please give feedback and comments.

THe jig will be updated and modified based on trials and user feedback.


Next folder is The Shutter Keep

This gadget holds the shutter mech together externally from the camera body.

It allows the curtains to be checked for alignment and operation.

The hub sits in the top of the drum, with the dog facing down to engage the second curtain.

The top plate holds the top of the drum and rollers in position

and the strap can be used to hold the top plate in position. 

Ensure the exposed gear at the base of the drum is rotated fully anti-clockwise when the drum & curtains are in the correct 'fired' position.
This gear stops the drum rotating further, which would otherwise rip the ribbons & blind off th drum.

Tension can now be added to the rollers and operation ofthe shutter checked for operation & correct alignment.

Before removing The Shutter Keep, tension must be removed from the rollers.
