The Shutter Curtain Jig

This is for Zenit cameras.

The jig allows correct placement of the first curtain ribbons
and second curtain onto the drum.

They can then be glued to the drum.

This is an ongoing project in early alpha stage, so please give feedback and comments.

THe jig will be updated and modified based on trials and user feedback.
